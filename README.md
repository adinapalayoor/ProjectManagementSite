# Project Management Site
Built a project management site using Java, HTML and JavaScript and connected it all using AWS tools.

## Back-end
We used Java to build all the back-end code. We created handlers to allow users to create and delete projects, add and remove tasks, add and remove teammates and numerous other capabilities. These handlers as well as the tests for the handlers are within the "final project" file. Additionally, within the "db" file it contains the classes that allow us to connect the functionality of the handlers into the database itself. Each class includes lines of SQL queries.
